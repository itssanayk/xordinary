# XORDINARY TOUCH

It is an Image Processing Software which can convert any ordinary monitor or desktop to a touch screen display.
It requires a normal web camera and a red LED bulb with a battery.
The web cam will capture the monitor display and the movement of red LED light in front of the screen will 
cause certain interactive features like clicking, drawing, etc.
Basically this tool can be used as an alternative for a generic mouse pointer or any other pointing device.
